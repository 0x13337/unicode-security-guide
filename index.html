### Unicode Security Guide
_Home Page_

Welcome to the _Unicode Security Guide_! This guide is designed to give Web application developers, software engineers, and application security researches a reference for understanding Unicode and it's relationship to operating systems, applications, and the Web. The dynamics of Unicode, and character encodings in general, are often misunderstood, poorly documented, and lead to an array of interesting if not catastrophic security vulnerabilities.
